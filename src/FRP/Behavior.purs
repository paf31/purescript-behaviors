-- | `ABehavior` is the more general type of `Behavior`, which is parameterized
-- | over some underlying `event` type.
-- |
-- | Normally, you should use `Behavior` instead, but this type
-- | can also be used with other types of events, including the ones in the
-- | `Semantic` module.
newtype ABehavior event a = ABehavior (forall b. event (a -> b) -> event b)

-- | A `Behavior` acts like a continuous function of time.
-- |
-- | We can construct a sample a `Behavior` from some `Event`, combine `Behavior`s
-- | using `Applicative`, and sample a final `Behavior` on some other `Event`.

-- | Integrate with respect to some measure of time.
-- |
-- | This function approximates the integral using the trapezium rule at the
-- | implicit sampling interval.
-- |
-- | The `Semiring` `a` should be a vector field over the field `t`. To represent
-- | this, the user should provide a _grate_ which lifts a multiplication
-- | function on `t` to a function on `a`. Simple examples where `t ~ a` can use
-- | the `integral'` function instead.
